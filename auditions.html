    <h1>Auditions</h1>

      <div class="container">
      <p>We will be holding auditions on Sunday, January 25th at 3pm at the Cesar Chavez Basement near Strawberry Creek! If you are interested in being a part of this amazing group, please come!</p>

      <P>P5 auditions emphasize sight-reading, blending, pitch, and ability to hold one's part through vocal exercises and individual and group sight-reading tasks. Auditionees are also asked to prepare a short solo, preferably in the classical style, for the audition. We may have a callback audition to hear more on blend and part-holding.</p>

      <P>We are always looking for experienced singers, and encourage all who are interested to audition!
      If you have scheduled an <a href="http://ucce.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">UCCE</a> general audition, please indicate on the form that you are interested in P5. If you have any questions, please feel free to email our <a href="mailto:perfectfifth@ucchoral.berkeley.edu"> business manager</a>.</p>
